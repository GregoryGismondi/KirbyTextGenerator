 This is a fun little coding project based off of my doodles where I have my poorly
 drawn version of Kirby holding up signs that say messages. I wanted to create a
 digital version of it, and was inspired by ASCII artwork. The code allows for the sign
 that Kirby is holding up to be easily customizable!

 - Only includes a few characters
 
 v.02 - Hanging Letters Update
 
 - Support for letters that go below other characters (such as 'g')
 - Includes support a few more characters (letters + a symbol)
